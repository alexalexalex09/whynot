#A card game
Everybody starts with an ace in front of them and on your turn you can either lay down a card one higher than any card on the table or draw a card. You can also at any time choose to discard your entire hand. If you do, add up the total value of the cards in your hand, anything above a jack is worth 10, and draw a card. If the card is higher than the value of the hand, you win. If the card is lower, continue drawing until you've drawn the number of cards indicated by that card. Whoever goes out first wins. If someone lays a king down on the table, the next card that can be played is an ace, and it wraps around to a 2.
